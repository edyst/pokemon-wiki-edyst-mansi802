      <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
      <p>
        Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published
        by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media
        franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
        Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and
        the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the
        "core series" by their developers

          <h4>Water</h4>
          <p>
            Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
            on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

            Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
            choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
            players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5
            defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.

          <h4>Statistics of weight loss</h4>
          <p>
            The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that
            discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting
            parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
            themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that
            he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

            most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has
            grossed almost $2 billion in revenue and been downloaded 800 million
            times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was in 2016, the
            game remains incredibly popular.

      <h2>Q and A</h2>
      <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>

        <li>
          <p>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</p>
          <ul class="unordered__list">
            <li>
              We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
              quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
              trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
              evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
              evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of
              electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
              Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able
              to answer.

          <p>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</p>
          <ul class="unordered__list">
            <li>
              Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you
              start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed
              if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
              Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way
              through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're
              presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is
              a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.

            Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the

            constant focus of the anime.

          <p>
            Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon
            games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different:
            in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly
            different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a
            December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.

              The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games
              (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi
              Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release
              of Pocket Monsters Red and Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When
              these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released
              sometime after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon
              Red and Blue for international release. The original Green version
              was not released outside Japan
